Early Saturday mornings, the cold breeze, and the chirps of birds remind me of you. 
The intensity of which the sun shines on a winter day reminds me of you. Oh, my Apricity, can I bask in you? 
Will I burn if I come too close, wither if I stray too far? Will you freeze my greys and melt the ice, or would I turn to steam under your touch? 
I breathe beneath you, Apricity. You're the sun who painted my blue skies warm.
